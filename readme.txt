Get full control as to which payment method to be shown/hide for each customer's billing or shipping location or order total. Easiest way to reduce abandonment, payment fees and fraudulent transactions.

== Description ==

Show/Hide available payment methods based on customer’s billing or shipping address, or order total. Increase conversions, reduce frauds and payment processing fees.

Not all payment gateways are equal. Some work better for fraud reduction, some have lower fees, some have higher acceptance from customers. 
Conditional Payment Methods for WooCommerce plugin lets you add restriction rules for available payment gateways during checkout. You can disable (or enable) gateways by customer’s order total or billing or shipping location. No need to hire a developer or work with custom code. You can set up all conditions with a simple screen within WooCommerce.

= Why should I pick and choose available payment methods during checkout? =
Quite a few reasons...
* Show gateways people know and trust: PayPal, Stripe… When people see them, they feel safe and secure - and do not abandon.
* Local payment methods increase conversion: Conditionally offering a payment gateway popular in specific geography significantly increases conversion because potential customers are more comfortable. Showing this gateway to all other customers may be counter-productive.
* Lower fees for you: Some gateways charge high fees for international transactions. Using a direct bank transfer may be better for higher value orders. Lowering your costs increases your profits. So showing the right gateways is best for everyone.
* Minimize frauds, refunds and chargebacks: Certain locations have higher fraud rates. Certain payment methods make it very easy for customers to raise disputes and you end up losing much more than the original order money. So disabling payment methods that are potential problems in certain situations will lower your risk and worries.
* Too many gateways is bad, relevant gateways is good: It makes sense to offer many different ways of payment methods to customers. But showing them all during checkout will increase confusion - and hence abandonment. Conditionally showing relevant payment methods solves all the problems.
